because of that cute smile
because of that big butt
that's the tweet.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
and your curly hair
:)))
because of your music taste!
and all of your imperfections.
even though you live 150km away
because you care
because you remember the little stuff
for sitting on that bench with me
couuunttryyy boooyyyy
because of all the vine references
bc your gay as hell
and your genshin streams
and the pink kitty ears
for calling me dumbass
for saying "wat mot je" when i call
for teaching me how to kiss
for being with me
and that pretty face of yours on stream
and those tiddies
cause you're a cutieee
and the playlists you send me
and your kpop lore explanations
even though you don't want to show it sometimes
for calling me gay
for communicating with me
for being a good friend too
for all the drama you share
for texting with me until deep in the night
because holding your hand is fun
because you're you.
and I'm not gonna stop anytime soon
and your little dances
and the way you laugh
periodt.
i really really do
for making me feel ways i never have before
for all of the "5 more minutes" during calls
for the tight hugs you give
for the way you look at me
for all the small kisses
and i love waking up to your texts
for teaching me some words 
and i miss giving you hugs sometimes
and those soft lips
for making random noises
for walking through the forest with me
"whaattt??" "youve never played tuber simulator??"
